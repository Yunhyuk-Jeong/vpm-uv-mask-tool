# **Iyan-Kim UV Mask Tool**

### _Material-slot based UV island mask generation for Unity Editor_

`Iyan-Kim UV Mask Tool` is a Unity **Editor-only utility** for selecting UV islands from a renderer's material slot and exporting them as **PNG mask textures**.  
It helps artists and avatar creators quickly generate texture masks from complex meshes without manually repainting UV areas in external tools.

✔ 100% Editor-only tool  
✔ No runtime footprint  
✔ Material slot based UV island selection  
✔ PNG mask export for texture workflows  
✔ Designed for VPM / VCC distribution

## 🔧 **Features**

Iyan-Kim UV Mask Tool streamlines UV mask creation by providing:

### 🧩 **Material Slot Based UV Detection**

-   Select a renderer and choose a **material slot**
-   Automatically reads the triangles used by the selected material slot
-   Detects UV islands from the selected slot only
-   Works well for avatars, outfits, props, and modular meshes

### 🖱 **Interactive UV Island Selection**

-   Click UV islands directly in the preview
-   Select all, invert selection, or clear selection
-   Hover and selection feedback in the UV preview
-   Optional Scene View highlight for selected islands

### 🖼 **PNG Mask Export**

-   Export selected UV islands as a PNG mask texture
-   Resolution presets: `256`, `512`, `1024`, `2048`, `4096`
-   Custom resolution support up to `8192`
-   Configurable background color, selected color, and alpha
-   Optional padding and anti-aliasing

### 🧭 **Renderer Coverage**

-   Supports both `MeshRenderer` and `SkinnedMeshRenderer`
-   Reads meshes from `MeshFilter.sharedMesh` or `SkinnedMeshRenderer.sharedMesh`
-   Handles material slots with valid submesh triangles
-   Automatically detects usable UV channels

### 🌐 **Multi-language UI**

-   English / Korean / Japanese support
-   Language can be switched directly in the window
-   Language preference is saved in Unity Editor preferences

### 🛠 **Editor-friendly UX**

-   Simple renderer object field workflow
-   Zoomable and pannable UV preview
-   Large export warning for high memory operations
-   Clear status messages for missing meshes, UVs, and material slots

## 🧠 How It Works

-   Select a `MeshRenderer` or `SkinnedMeshRenderer`
-   Choose the target **Material Slot**
-   The tool reads the submesh triangles used by that slot
-   Usable UV channels are detected automatically
-   UV islands are generated from connected UV triangles
-   Selected islands are rasterized into a PNG mask

💡 **Tip**  
For best results, use meshes with clean UV islands and enable **Read/Write** in the model import settings if Unity cannot read mesh data.
